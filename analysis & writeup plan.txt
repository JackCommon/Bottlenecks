# Analysis & Write-up Plan for Common & Westra (2018) revisions
## Analysis
- Analyse phenotype data for dilution and control experiments
- Analyse spacer data for dilution experiment
- Incoporate control data into the main datasets for all experiments, and 
rerun analysis to compare with treatments
	1. CFU counts
	2. Phenotype data
- Survival analysis of control data
- Calculate estimated diversity loss due to bottlenecking (use Sean's data)
- Sort out CFU data for plate experiment t0, 2, 4

## Write-up
- Phenotype figures for dilution and control experiment (seperate or as 
part of the main figures?)
- Spacer figures for dilution experiment
- Supplementary figs of CFUs
- Updated stats/tables for:
	- Plate experiment repeat
	- PFU~CFU model
	- All models re-ran with control data
- Textual changes:
	- All minor comments
	- Dilution effect idea into Intro
	- Results/Discussion of dilution experiment
	- Expected diversity
